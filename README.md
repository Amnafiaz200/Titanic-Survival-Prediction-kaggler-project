**Titanic Survival Prediction — Custom Decision Tree, Random Forest & SVM**
**Description**
This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning models implemented from scratch, without relying on scikit-learn classifiers. It demonstrates how classic algorithms such as Decision Trees and Random Forests work internally and includes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for performance comparison.
The repository provides a hands-on approach to building predictive models and evaluating their accuracy.

**Features**
**Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and select important features.
**Custom Decision Tree**: Fully implemented algorithm for classification.
**Custom Random Forest**: Ensemble of decision trees to improve accuracy.
**SVM Classifier**: Comparison using Support Vector Machine.

**Dataset**
Uses the Titanic dataset, containing passenger information such as age, sex, class, and survival status.
